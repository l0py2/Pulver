1.0a:
* Updated: Forge, should no longer crash
* Broke: **Textures. I am aware they are broken. I do not know how to fix them.**
1.0:
I think this is a pretty complete mod. Does great things
* Added: Debug mode for when I'm developing
* Added: Tooltip when in Debug mode (F3 + H) showing what mod necessitates the dust
* Changed: Textures! Thanks to CyanideX once again!
* Changed: Internal stuff, mostly just refactors but a few nice things.

1.0.0.2:
* Fixed: Server crash on startup

1.0.0.1:
* Changed: Everything (again)! System is the same, but thanks to @mezz and his JEI color searching code, all entries are 100% dynamic!

1.0.0.0:
* Added: Everything! Initial Release!
